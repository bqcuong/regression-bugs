IncompleteSequences are removed
`FastaReader` isolated into sepparate entity (now it can read AminoAcid sequences) and special wrapper is created (`FastaSequenceReaderWrapper`) to wire it back to SequenceReader abstraction
`BatchAligner` abstraction
`SimpleBatchAligner`
Extancive binding to Blast implemeting BatchAligner abstraction for interoperability with other BatchAligners
many other small modifications to support new abstraction
